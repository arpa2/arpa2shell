This module is a fork from cmdparser.cmdparser by Andy Pearce.
We included it as a part of arpa2shell because maintenance of the
original seems to have ceased, and we needed the JSON extension
for the ARPA2 project.  The package retains its general nature,
however, and may be of use to anyone as a JSON enhanced drop-in
for the original cmdparser.cmdparser.  To use it, simply import
arpa2shell.cmdparser instead of cmdparser.cmdparser.
