# ARPA2 Shell for ACL Management

> *The arpa2acl shell is a generic mechanism for setting up ACL information.
> An ACL defines who is permitted to do what.*

An ACL is a general instrument for management of rights by users or, more
dynamically, role occupants.  In the ARPA2 project, we recognise two classes
of rights:

  * Communication (with a certain peer)
  * Resource use

More information on this is on the following pages:

  * [Identity-based Access Control](http://donai.arpa2.net/acl.html)
  * [Forms of Identity](http://donai.arpa2.net/idtypes.html)

## Using the ARPA2 Shell for ACL Management

To start the shell, run the following command from an operating system
command line or the ARPA2 meta-shell named `arpa2shell` with the
command

```
arpa2acl
```

Use the `help` function to check the details.  This shell has not been
fully finalised yet.
